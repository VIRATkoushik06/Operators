'''
def calculate_devki_age(dhoni_age):
    # In 3 years, Dhoni's age
    dhoni_future_age = dhoni_age + 3
    # Devki's age in 3 years would be 4 times Dhoni's future age
    devki_future_age = 4 * dhoni_future_age
    # Current age of Devki
    devki_current_age = devki_future_age - 3
    return devki_current_age

# Main program
dhoni_age = int(input("Enter Dhoni's current age: "))
devki_age = calculate_devki_age(dhoni_age)
print(devki_age)
